# AboutMe - Work in Progress

 ### Hobbies
 I like to keep active with Muay Thai, Hot Yoga, Basketball or Skateboarding. I'm also a certified Windsurf Instructor and when I'm not exercising, I try to keep healthy (I even grew my own Wheat- and Barleygrass back then for juicing, nowadays I juice the grass from the backyard or resort to powders). To balance out the healthy side, I'm an avid baker who likes to create his own variations. And yes, someone just reminded me that I used to be a Dj, I had almost forgotten about it, but I still have my Faderfox Dj Midi Controller (at the bottom of the picture).

### Card game
While playing with my kids, we came up with two cardgames: One of those is still in its early stages but the other one I went ahead and designed, had it printed and got wooden game pieces for it. We're currently in the testing stage. It's called "Burg", the German word for Castle.

### Travel
I've been around the world, from China to Haiti and everywhere in between, from mountains to caves, from tourist destinations to completely off the beaten track. And I'm glad I did it when I had the opportunity!:)
